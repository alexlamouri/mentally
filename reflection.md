Reflection
------------
At first we attempted to have weekly in-person meetings, however members were often busy and could not attend. Therefore, we switched to an online meeting, which was much better as everyone was able to attend and contribute to the meeting and the meeting did not keep getting pushed. Having at least one live meeting per week helped us to plan the sprint better and implement any process changes needed based on the previous sprint. 

Using JIRA also worked to our advantage since it made it really easy for us to track our user stories and what we exactly had to finish before the next sprint.

Something that did not work well was our software design plan. Our overall plan was too general which led to difficulties during the development of our app. We were all sometimes confused about which features we were including and which we decided not to do. Something to improve would be to start with a more detailed plan and at the beginning of each sprint, go into even more details regarding the requirements and expectations of each story. This would make it much less confusing for developers while also preventing problems later when merging all the user stories. 

We also had an issue where we all ended up with different views and themes due to the fact that we did not plan strictly before. We should have made wireframes with a proper color scheme. That way, when we all made our features, the views wouldn’t have looked so different.

We will keep doing online meetings (due to different schedules and the current pandemic) since it was working so well for us. We will also write up whatever we decide on doing first so we know exactly what we will be making. Making professional wireframes that include a decided colour scheme would be next. Division of user stories and the sprint length of two weeks worked well for us so we will be continuing that. Jira proved to be very helpful so we will consistently use that as well.
